The company does not own any of the real estate listings, nor does it host events; it acts as a broker, receiving commissions from each booking. Guests can search for lodging using filters such as lodging type, dates, location, and price, and can search for specific types of homes, such as bed and breakfasts, unique homes, and vacation homes.<p>";
